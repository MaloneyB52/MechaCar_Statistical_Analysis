Linear Regression to Predict MPG

  We tested various variables among automobiles to produce non-random variance to MPG. Meaning, targeted testing utilizinv variables such as vehicle weight, ground clearance and spoiler angle. To do this, we used a t-test, to determine if there was a significant difference the means of these groups. We believe the slope will rnot differ much from zero. We do not believe this model is a good predictorr of MPG as the non-measured variables, engine, aerodynamics etc...will have a greater impact
  
  Studty Design: MechaCar vs Competition
  
  We intend to test MPG due to engine size and aerodynamic drag. Both tested and compared individually. The hypothesis is that if an engine is larger, it has lower MPG. On the Aerodymanic drag, flatter cares produce parasite drag and slimmer cars, induced drag. We believe aerodymamics has less of an impact on MPG than engine size. By rumming similiar T tests we can compare data and plot the correlation of MPG to see results. 
  
  We need 6 months of data, various tracks and weather conditions and a standard distances per car to achieve standardization.
